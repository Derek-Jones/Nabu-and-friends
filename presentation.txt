You have arrived at venue full of people and want to meet people
who share some of your interests.

Looking at your phone makes you look stand-offish and unapproachable.

The solution is to be a member of Nabu-and-Friends.

Your Razer Nabu alerts you when somebody sharing your specified
interests is within 10 m.

Somebody interesting is close by, but which person is it?

Nabu-and-Friends has sent you information about them.
Now you need to look at your phone,  the people you will soon be
talking to will also be looking at their phone learning about you.
